The app provides a touchpad-like user interface and can be used really like a touchpad!

Also it provides a keyboard which you can use to type to the PC.

The functions of the touchpad include MOVE, LEFT\_BUTTON, RIGHT\_BUTTON, DRAG, TAP TO CLICK (can be disabled) and the _WHEELBUTTON_.
To click the _WHEELBUTTON_, just tap with 2 fingers close to each other in a horizontal line. Keep the 2 fingers down and move them up or down together to realize the scroll-down / scroll-up function.
